## Hi everyone, i'm Patricia 👋

#### About me 😎
 I'm 22 years old. I have always admired the technology field, but I didn't really know what to do. Then, around 2023, I had my first contact with the world of programming, and soon after, I found [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br), which was essential for me, helping me to decide once and for all that this is what I wanted.
 
Currently, I am in my first semester of Systems Analysis and Development at [Estácio](https://estacio.br/a-estacio/unidades/parangaba?srsltid=AfmBOopTC6udGXxNIkbPhStV9OnU1XYHJUPFixxofByG4a2tTrDVfk-E) to ensure a good journey towards getting my first job in the field as a `developer`. I am constantly evolving and improving my skills every day.🚀🤩👩‍💻
